I am pursuing a Master's of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Professor [Pulkit Agrawal](people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/). Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT. My main research interests include embodied intelligence, robot learning, and visual control.Currently, I am investigating vision-conditioned locomotion for the [MIT Mini Cheetah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6fMV1UPzkg). In my free time, I enjoy rowing on the Charles River.
