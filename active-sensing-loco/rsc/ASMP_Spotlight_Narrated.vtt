Learning to see physical properties with active sensing motor policies.

2
00:00:05.001 --> 00:00:09.500
Consider a drone image of a terrain and a few candidate paths for a legged robot. 

3
00:00:09.501 --> 00:00:14.000
Depending on the task, the relative frictions of terrains will have different bearing on the optimal path. 

4
00:00:14.001 --> 00:00:18.000
We develop a pipeline to inform such plans by perceiving terrain properties.

5
00:00:18.001 --> 00:00:24.500
We propose Active Sensing Motor Policies, which adapt the robotâ€™s behavior to accurately estimate physical information,

6
00:00:24.501 --> 00:00:29.500
for example, intentionally swiping the feet against the ground to feel the friction parameter.

7
00:00:29.501 --> 00:00:35.000
Active Sensing Motor Policies allow us to label the terrain properties from a few minutes of traversal.

8
00:00:35.001 --> 00:00:40.500
The robot then learns a self-supervised vision module that densely predicts the terrain physics from RGB images.

9
00:00:40.501 --> 00:00:46.500
The vision module can generalize to images from a teamed drone which facilitates semantics-aware path planning.

10
00:00:46.501 --> 00:00:51.500
We can select efficient locomotion paths under new conditions using the same vision module. 

11
00:00:51.501 --> 00:00:57.500
The robot decides to cross the grass when walking alone but keeps the payload on the sidewalk to walk faster.

00:00:57.501 --> 00:00:60.000
