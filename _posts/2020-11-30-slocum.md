From Winter 2018 to Spring 2019, I investigated autonomous science on the [Slocum Glider](https://www.video.teledynemarine.com/video/35861012/slocum-glider-overview), supervised by Brian Williams in MIT's [Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems Group (MERS)](http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mers/). Our focus was on enabling the long-range underwater vehicle to efficently plan to gather information about the relationships between properties of its environment. The resulting thesis, presentation, and code can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/gmargo11/MIPP).
