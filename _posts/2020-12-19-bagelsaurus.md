Bagelsaurus is located in Cambridge, right on Mass Ave near Porter Square. The line for this bagel shop typically spills well down the block on weekends, and it's clear why. These bagels are on the smaller and lighter side, but the crisp outside and chewy interior of the plain bagel deliver big texture. The everything bagel retains this crust structure nicely, and accommodates a well-apportioned layer of seasoning. Cream cheese is generously spread and embodies a nice balance of fluff and cream. An overall great bagel. **Score: 9.1**
