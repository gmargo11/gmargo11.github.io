In Summer 2019, I spent three months at GM's [Global Technical Center](https://www.gm.com/our-company/us/techcenter.html) in Warren, Michigan. I was a member of the Advanced Engineering group's Autonomous Driving Advanced Sensing team, led by Jon Gerlach. While there, I developed a sensor alignment and validation software tool which eliminated hours of manual labor each time a car's sensor suite was modified. I also met with suppliers and analyzed emerging sensing technologies, including event-based cameras.
