I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant to Howie Shrobe in Fall 2020. This joint course taught for computer scientists and aerospace engineers introduces planning as state-space search, then takes a dive into algorithms for reasoning efficiently under constraints and uncertainty. Our primary textbook is Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach by Russell & Norvig.
