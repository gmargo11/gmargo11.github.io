I am a Graduate Teaching Assistant to Howie Shrobe this Fall 2020. This joint course, populated by undergraduate and graduate computer scientists and aerospace engineers, introduces its roughly eighty students to planning as state-space search, then takes a dive into algorithms for reasoning efficiently under constraints and uncertainty. Our primary textbook is [Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach](http://aima.cs.berkeley.edu/) by Russell & Norvig. I hold recitations and office hours, write exams and problem sets, and advise group-based final projects, alongside one other awesome TA.
