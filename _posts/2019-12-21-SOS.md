In Fall 2019, I enrolled in a new seminar course in the MIT Aerospace Engineering department: 16.S498 Risk-Aware and Robust Nonlinear Planning. This course, taught by Ashkan Jasour, covered the theory and method of nonlinear optimization and its application to safe control of dynamic systems under uncertainty.

A particular focus of our learning this semester was Sum of Squares (SOS) programming. A SOS program solver takes advantage of the fact that any expression that is the sum of squared polynomials is guaranteed to be nonnegative for all inputs. The solver searches for such SOS polynomials to satisfy a given set of inequality constraints, and this operation can be applied to efficiently optimize a nonconvex, nonlinear objective.
