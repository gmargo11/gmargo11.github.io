subtitle: "Chasing Information Gain in Dynamical Systems"

From Spring 2019 to Winter 2020, I studied connections between optimal control and neural learning under the supervision of Sai Ravela in MIT's [Earth Signals and Systems Group](https://essg.mit.edu/). We developed a method which quantifies uncertainty in the parameters of a neural network during supervised learning using Ensemble Kalman Filtering, then efficiently learns the structure for a compact neural representation of a dynamical system by maximizing information gain. We presented our paper, avaiable on [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2008.09915), at the DDDAS 2020 Conference.
