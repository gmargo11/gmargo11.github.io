In Spring 2021, I'll be a Graduate Teaching Assistant to Luca Carlone in MIT's premier hands-on robotics course (back for my third year of involvement). Students program an autonomous driving stack from the ground up, implementing control, path planning, localization algorithms in ROS and deploying them in simulation as well as on real hardware. The semester culminates with the grand challenge: a no-holds-barred autonomous race through the basement of MIT's [Stata Center](https://www.csail.mit.edu/about/stata-center). This year, our large course staff will support both a socially distanced in-person challenge and an online challenge.
