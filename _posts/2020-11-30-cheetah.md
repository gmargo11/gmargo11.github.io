Since Spring 2020, I've been working on giving the [MIT Mini Cheetah](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6fMV1UPzkg) visual intelligence. With this work, supervised by Pulkit Agrawal in collaboration with Sangbae Kim's [Biomimetic Robotics Laboratory](https://biomimetics.mit.edu/), we aim to unlock the potential of legged robots to robustly navigate highly discontinuous terrains without extensive pre-mapping or offline trajectory optimization. Our approach combines robot learning with proven model-based control architectures, and our development process has involved extensive integration of control, sensing, hardware, simulation, and testbed components.
