Robotics: Science and Systems (6.141/16.405J) is a robotics class taught by Luca Carlone and Sertac Karaman, two MIT AeroAstro faculty who are at the cutting edge of navigation and control for autonomous vehicles. The class is an intensive lab-based introduction to the design and implementation of autonomous systems in ROS. 

This spring, my team completed six labs encompassing low-level control, camera-based perception, LiDAR-based state estimation via particle filtering, and sampling- and search-based path planning. For each lab, we wrote a report and delivered a presentation describing and evaluating the system we had implemented. Once we had completed all six labs, our racecar was capable of autonomously navigating any mapped environment.
