I created this personal website today using Jekyll and GitHub Pages!

Over the next week or so, I'll make a few retroactive entries about work I've enjoyed so far this year. After I'm through that, I hope to keep this space alive with real-time updates on projects and other miscellaneous thoughts I may have.
