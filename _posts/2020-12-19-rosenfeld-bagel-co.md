Rosenfeld Bagel Co serves up a thick NY-style bagel just outside the city in Newton, MA. It's some of the best New York style you'll find in greater Boston. Step through the door into a cozy space with overflowing bagel bins front and center. The plain bagel is New York thick and doughy, and the crust has a middling chew. The everything bagel seems to have a slightly stronger exterior crisp, but toppings are applied fairly sparsely to the upper and lower halves. Cream cheese is of the classic style, laid on thick and dense. This is closer to a New York bagel than most you'll find in Boston, and its great atmosphere is accompanied by a solid bite. **Score: 7.2**
