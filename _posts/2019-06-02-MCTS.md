Cognitive Robotics (16.412/6.834J) is a class at MIT offered jointly each Spring by the Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science departments. This Spring, the class was taught by Professor Brian Williams with assistance from TA Marlyse Reeves. Building on material from the prerequisite 16.410: Autonomy and Decision Making, Cognitive Robotics surveyed research conducted by Professor Williams' Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems (MERS) group at MIT in the areas of temporal reasoning, risk-bounded planning, model-based programming, and diagnosis.

In addition to the lectures delivered by the course staff and members of MERS, a series of Advanced Lectures was delivered by student teams throughout the semester. Given an advanced topic assignment, student teams researched the state of the art and delivered an 80-minute Advanced Lecture which conveyed their findings to the rest of the class. Each team also implemented a problem set, in the form of a jupyter notebook, to be completed by classmates.

In our lecture and problem set, my team addressed the application of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to the task of multi-agent collaboration. We first introduced the class to the core MCTS algorithm in a single-agent planning context. Then, we presented a survey of recent work on applying this algorithm to multi-agent collaborative scenarios. My primary contribution was to design and present slides introducing the MCTS algorithm in a single-agent context (15:25-47:50 in the video). Check out the materials my team produced for our lecture and problem set here:

Once our team's Advanced Lecture had been delivered, we began work towards the final portion of the class: the Grand Challenge. Working with the teams that had specialized in Active Sampling and Path Planning, my team implemented algorithms in ROS to enable a pair of TurtleBots to collaboratively explore a toy environment representing an AUV deployment. We also implemented several extensions which applied or extended the state of the art in collaborative MCTS. These included the application of a neural network heuristic, a decentralized algorithm for collaborative planning under limited communication, and a hierarchical modeling approach which enabled asymmetric collaborative planning between a mothership and tethered AUV. I primarily designed and implemented the hierchical tethered AUV-mothership collaboration model; the relevant report and code are available below:
