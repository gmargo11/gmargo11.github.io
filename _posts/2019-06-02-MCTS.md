Cognitive Robotics (16.412/6.834J) is a class at MIT offered jointly each Spring by the Aerospace Engineering and Computer Science departments. This Spring, the class was taught by Professor Brian Williams with assistance from TA Marlyse Reeves. Building on material from the prerequisite 16.410: Autonomy and Decision Making, Cognitive Robotics surveyed research conducted by Professor Williams' Model-based Embedded and Robotic Systems (MERS) group at MIT in the areas of temporal reasoning, risk-bounded planning, model-based programming, and diagnosis.

In addition to the lectures delivered by the course staff and members of MERS, a series of Advanced Lectures was delivered by student teams throughout the semester. Given an advanced topic assignment, student teams researched the state of the art and delivered an 80-minute Advanced Lecture which conveyed their findings to the rest of the class. Each team also implemented a problem set, in the form of a jupyter notebook, to be completed by classmates.

In our lecture and problem set, my team addressed the application of Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) to the task of multi-agent collaboration. We first introduced the class to the core MCTS algorithm in a single-agent planning context. Then, we presented a survey of recent work on applying this algorithm to multi-agent collaborative scenarios. My primary contribution was to design and present slides introducing the MCTS algorithm in a single-agent context (15:25-47:50 in the video). Check out the materials my team produced for our lecture and problem set here:
