<p>I am pursuing a Masterâ€™s of Engineering in Artificial Intelligence at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, advised by Professor <a href="http://people.csail.mit.edu/pulkitag/">Pulkit Agrawal</a>. Previously, I was an undergraduate at MIT. My main research interests include embodied intelligence, robot learning, and visual control. Currently, I am investigating vision-conditioned locomotion for the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6fMV1UPzkg">MIT Mini Cheetah</a>. In my free time, I enjoy rowing on the Charles River.</p>
